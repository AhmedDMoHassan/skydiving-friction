# Skydiving in the existence of friction:
Solving the problem of the falling airplane in the existance of friction. this problem is like the ones in High school except it had complexity (Friction).
to solve this problem, i attacked it in numerical sense then modeled the answer to visualize the change with respect to time and distance.

hope you enjoy it and evolve on it!
